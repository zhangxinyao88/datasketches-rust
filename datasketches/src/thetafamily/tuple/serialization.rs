//! Binary serialization of Tuple sketches.
//!
//! The Tuple compact format reuses the uncompressed Theta layout (preamble, flags, theta) but uses
//! the Tuple family id, carries a sketch-type byte, and stores the user summary bytes after each
//! retained hash. See the C++/Java reference implementations for the on-disk format.
//!
//! A Tuple sketch keeps a user-defined summary next to every retained key. Because the summary
//! type is opaque to the sketch, (de)serialization of summaries is delegated to the summary type
//! itself via the [`TupleSummaryValue`] trait, mirroring `FrequentItemValue`.
