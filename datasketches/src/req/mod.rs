//! Relative Error Quantiles (REQ) sketch.
//!
//! [`ReqSketch`] provides bounded-memory rank, quantile, PMF, and CDF estimates with
//! configurable relative accuracy at either end of the rank domain. It is based on
//! [Relative Error Streaming Quantiles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01668) and the Apache
//! DataSketches C++ implementation.
//!
//! # Item ordering
//!
//! The REQ paper defines input items as coming from a totally ordered universe. Accordingly,
//! sketch items must implement [`Ord`]. Rust's `f32` and `f64` do not implement `Ord` because NaN
//! is unordered; wrap floating-point items in [`ReqFloat`], whose constructor rejects NaN. Signed
//! zeros compare equal and infinities retain their usual numerical order.
//!
//! Custom item types need only [`Clone`] and [`Ord`] for in-memory use. Serialization additionally
//! requires [`ReqValue`].
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```
//! use datasketches::common::SearchCriteria;
//! use datasketches::req::ReqFloat;
//! use datasketches::req::ReqSketch;
//!
//! let mut sketch = ReqSketch::default();
//! for value in [1.0, 2.0, 3.0] {
//!     sketch.update(ReqFloat::<f64>::new(value)?);
//! }
//!
//! let median = sketch.quantile(0.5, SearchCriteria::Inclusive)?;
//! assert_eq!(median.into_inner(), 2.0);
//! # Ok::<(), datasketches::error::Error>(())
//! ```
