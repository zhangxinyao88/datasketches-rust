//! # Apache® DataSketches™ Core Rust Library Component
//!
//! This crate provides compact, mergeable summaries for answering queries over large data streams.
//! It implements a subset of the algorithms available in the other Apache DataSketches language
//! components.
//!
//! ## Enabling sketches
//!
//! Sketch implementations are opt-in Cargo features; this crate enables none by default. Enable
//! only the algorithms an application uses:
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo add datasketches --features hll,theta
//! ```
//!
//! Each feature exposes a same-named module. For example, `hll` exposes `datasketches::hll` and
//! `tdigest` exposes `datasketches::tdigest`.
//!
//! ## Choosing a sketch
//!
//! * Use `bloom` for probabilistic membership queries.
//! * Use `countmin` for point-frequency estimates and `frequencies` for discovering heavy hitters.
//! * Use `hll` for fast distinct counts, `cpc` for compact serialized distinct counts, or `theta`
//!   when set operations are required.
//! * Use `kll`, `req`, or `tdigest` for ranks and quantiles. KLL provides strong general-purpose
//!   rank accuracy, REQ targets configurable high- or low-rank accuracy, and T-Digest emphasizes
//!   distribution tails.
//! * Use `tuple` when retained Theta keys need application-defined summaries.
//!
//! See each module's documentation for accuracy, memory, serialization, and update examples.
//!
//! ## Cross-language hashing
//!
//! Compatible serialization does not by itself make ordinary Rust [`Hash`](std::hash::Hash)
//! input compatible with Java, C++, or Go. Rust strings and slices include type-specific framing,
//! and short integers require different widening rules for different sketch families. When
//! sketches must represent the same updates across languages, use the wrappers in [`hash::value`]:
//!
//! * `raw_bytes` for byte and string contents;
//! * `canonical_float` for floating-point values;
//! * `sign_extend` for short integers used with HLL and CPC;
//! * `natural_extend` for short integers used with Bloom filters.
//!
//! Other DataSketches implementations skip empty strings rather than hashing them. Check for empty
//! input before updating when that cross-language behavior is required.
