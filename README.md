Apache DataSketches Rust provides stochastic streaming algorithms for answering queries over large data sets with compact, mergeable summaries. It is the core Rust component of Apache DataSketches and currently implements a subset of the algorithms available in the other language components.

## Getting started

Sketch implementations are opt-in Cargo features; the crate enables none by default. For example, add the HyperLogLog implementation with:

```shell
cargo add datasketches --features hll
```

Then build a sketch and query its distinct-count estimate:

```rust
use datasketches::hll::HllSketch;
use datasketches::hll::HllType;

let mut sketch = HllSketch::new(12, HllType::Hll8).unwrap();
for user in ["alice", "bob", "alice", "carol"] {
    sketch.update(user);
}

assert!(sketch.estimate() >= 3.0);
```

Enable multiple algorithms by listing their features together, such as `features = ["hll", "theta"]` in `Cargo.toml`.

## Available sketches

| Feature       | Main types                            | Use case                                                                                          |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `bloom`       | `BloomFilter`                         | Space-efficient probabilistic set membership with a configurable false-positive rate.             |
| `countmin`    | `CountMinSketch`                      | Approximate point-frequency queries over a stream.                                                |
| `cpc`         | `CpcSketch`, `CpcUnion`, `CpcWrapper` | Highly compact distinct-count estimation and unions.                                              |
| `frequencies` | `FrequentItemsSketch`                 | Heavy-hitter discovery with upper and lower frequency bounds.                                     |
| `hll`         | `HllSketch`, `HllUnion`               | Fast distinct-count estimation and unions.                                                        |
| `req`         | `ReqSketch`                           | Relative-error quantile, rank, PMF, and CDF queries with configurable high- or low-rank accuracy. |
| `tdigest`     | `TDigestMut`, `TDigest`               | Quantile and rank estimation, with high accuracy near distribution tails.                         |
| `theta`       | `ThetaSketch` and set operations      | Distinct counts, set expressions, and Jaccard similarity.                                         |
| `tuple`       | `TupleSketch` and set operations      | Theta-style keys with user-defined summaries attached to retained entries.                        |

See the [API documentation](https://docs.rs/datasketches) for configuration, accuracy guarantees, serialization, and examples for each algorithm. Runnable end-to-end scenarios live in [`datasketches/examples`](datasketches/examples).

## Compatibility

The minimum supported Rust version is 1.86.0. The crate currently supports little-endian targets only.

Supported serialization formats are tested with fixtures produced by Apache DataSketches Java, C++, and Go through the [DataSketches TCK](https://github.com/apache/datasketches-tck).

Serialization compatibility does not imply that an ordinary Rust `Hash` implementation produces the same update bytes as another language. When sketches must represent the same inputs across implementations, use `hash::value::{raw_bytes, canonical_float, sign_extend, natural_extend}` (and the constructors within those modules) to match the other language implementations’ hashing rules. Other DataSketches implementations skip empty strings, so skip them before updating when that behavior matters.

See the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) for release notes and migration guidance.

## Other language implementations

Apache DataSketches also provides core library components for other languages:

- [Java](https://github.com/apache/datasketches-java)
- [C++](https://github.com/apache/datasketches-cpp)
- [Python](https://github.com/apache/datasketches-python)
- [Go](https://github.com/apache/datasketches-go)
